**Employee Management System**
------------------------------

**Introduction**
----------------
The Employee Management System (EMS) is a comprehensive Java-based web application developed using Spring Boot. It provides robust features for managing employees, departments, and projects with advanced database operations and secure authentication mechanisms. The application is designed for scalability, ensuring efficient handling of CRUD operations, caching, and role-based access control with OAuth2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) integration.

**Key Features**
----------------
1. **Complete CRUD Operations**
   
    Manage core entities effectively:

    **Employees**: Add, update, delete, and retrieve employee information.
   
    **Departments**: Manage department data and hierarchies.

    **Projects**: Oversee project details, assignments, and budgets.
   
2. **Advanced Database Management**

    Uses MySQL or H2 for data persistence.
    Leverages Spring Data JPA for seamless database interaction.
    Implements custom queries for:
    Searching employees by criteria such as name, department, or project.
    Calculating total budgets allocated to projects within a department.
    Finding employees without project assignments.
    Listing employees working on specific projects.

3. **Authentication and Authorization**
   
    Integrated with OAuth2.0 and OIDC using the Authorization Code Flow.
    Supports external identity providers (Google, Auth0, Okta).
    Implements role-based access control:
      ADMIN: Full access to all operations.
      MANAGER: Department-specific access to employees and projects.
      EMPLOYEE: Limited access to their profile and projects.

4. **RESTful API Design**
   
    Provides well-structured, secure API endpoints:

    /employees: Manage employees (ADMIN, MANAGER).
    /departments: Manage departments (ADMIN, MANAGER).
    /projects: Manage projects (ADMIN, MANAGER).
    /employees/search: Search employees by criteria (ADMIN, MANAGER).
    /departments/{id}/projects: List projects in a department (ADMIN, MANAGER).

5. **Data Validation and Error Handling**
   
    Enforces strict validation to prevent invalid data entries.
    Provides comprehensive error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes.

6. **Extensive Unit Testing**
   
    Written with JUnit and Mockito.
    Covers:
      Controllers: Tests for all REST API endpoints.
      Services: Tests for business logic, caching, and validations.
      Repositories: Tests for database queries and interactions.
    Achieves a minimum of 80% code coverage.

**Technologies and Tools**
--------------------------
  Spring Boot for application framework.
  Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
  Spring Data JPA for ORM and database interactions.
  MySQL or H2 Database for persistence.
  OAuth2.0 and OpenID Connect for secure authentication.
  EhCache or Redis for caching.
  JUnit and Mockito for unit testing.
  Maven/Gradle as build tools.

**Getting Started**
--------------------

**Prerequisites**

  Java 17+ (JDK) , 
  Maven or Gradle , 
  MySQL or H2 Database , 
  Identity Provider for OAuth2.0 (e.g., Google, Auth0, Okta).

**Installation**
1. Clone the Repository
2. Configure Database
  Update the database properties in application.properties or application.yml:
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:EmployeeManagementDB
    spring.datasource.username=your-username
    spring.datasource.password=your-password
3. Run the Application
4. Access the Application
    Base URL: http://localhost:8080
5. Running Tests
    To execute all unit tests

**API Documentation**
